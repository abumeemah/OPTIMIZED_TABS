- **Improved user trust** by avoiding unfair credit losses

### 🎯 Credit Costs
- **Delete operations**: 1 FC
- **PDF exports**: 2 FC
- **All other operations**: FREE

## Benefits of New Logic

1. **Improved User Trust**: No credit loss for failed/cancelled operations
2. **Better UX**: Users can freely create and edit without credit concerns
3. **Fair Pricing**: Only charge for valuable actions (delete/export)
4. **Reduced Support**: Fewer complaints about unfair credit deductions
5. **Increased Usage**: Users more likely to use free create/edit features

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test create operations work without FC checks
2. Test delete operations deduct 1 FC after success
3. Test PDF exports deduct 2 FC after generation
4. Test FC deduction failures don't break operations
5. Test admin users bypass all FC deductions
6. Test insufficient credit warnings for delete/PDF operations
